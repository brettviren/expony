#+title: ðŸŽ  expony ðŸŽ 

This is a Python clone of the horribly addictive game [[https://www.bellika.dk/exponentile][exponentile]].  It has a
PyGame UI for game play that is inferior to the original.  The intention for
expony is to do some experimenting with alternative game board sizes, rules, UI
feedback, metrics, strategies, etc.

* Installation and usage

This package is still rather primitive

** GUI

*** Interactive play

To interactively play the game:
#+begin_example
$ uv run src/expony/gui.py
#+end_example

You can hit ~q~ to quit, ~r~ to reset.

*** Passive autoplay

#+begin_example
$ uv run src/expony/autogui.py
#+end_example

For now, the autogui ignores user input until game end.

** Tests

#+begin_example
$ uv run pytest
#+end_example

You may need ~--with pytest --with torch~.
Some tests are long running as they autoplay 100 games.

* Roadmap

Some considered features:

- [ ] Click cli.
- [ ] History (score, initial state, list of moves, date, duration)
- [ ] Undo, redo, browse moves.
- [ ] Autoplay (tests do this already, but include GUI to view progress).
- [ ] Button to provide single hint.
- [ ] See and choose from all possible next moves.
- [ ] Exhaustive autoplay (DFS/BFS search of best game).
