#+title ðŸŽ  expony ðŸŽ 

This is a Python clone of the horribly addictive game [[https://www.bellika.dk/exponentile][exponentile]].  It has a
PyGame UI for game play that is inferior to the original.  The intention for
expony is to do some experimenting with alternative game board sizes, rules, UI
feedback, metrics, strategies, etc.
